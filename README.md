Bank Management System
This project is a simple Bank Management System implemented in Python using file handling and serialization with pickle. The system allows users to create new bank accounts, update account details, check balances, deposit money, and withdraw funds. The project utilizes a text-based menu interface for user interaction.

Key Features
New Customer Registration

Allows users to create new bank accounts by providing account details such as name, address, phone number, government ID, account type, and initial deposit amount.
Records customer data using pickle serialization into a binary file (BMS.dat).
Account Management

Provides options for existing customers to manage their accounts:
Check account balance
Deposit money into the account
Withdraw money from the account (with sufficient balance check)
File Handling with Pickle

Utilizes pickle for serializing and deserializing Python objects, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of account records in a binary file.
Functionalities Overview
New Customer Registration (bankdetails Function)
Prompts the user to enter account details (account number, name, address, phone number, government ID, account type, initial deposit amount).
Stores the customer data in a list and writes the list to a binary file (BMS.dat) using pickle serialization.
